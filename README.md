# Pathfinding Demo

Visualization of many pathfinding algorithms. On the board, Green indicates the start position, Red Indicates the end Position, Yellow indicates visited nodes, and Blue indicates a path from start to end. Note that not all algorithms will achieve the shortest path.

Currently implemented algorithms:

- Breadth First
- Depth First
